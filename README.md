Using python to create a csv to be able to find the median location of a regions population using population data

The .csv files in this repository are the files that I used for the name and population data.

In excel I was then able to towns at which 50% of the population was above or below them for both the lat and long. Therefore creating a box at which the median of the population of the UK was.

This can be repeated for any area where you have the name and population data for. However, it does assume that a towns population is evenly distributed around it and that all smaller towns not included in the list are evenly distributed across the country.
